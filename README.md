# Gojo

**No-code solution for *ANYONE* to build a web3 prototype in less than 10 minutes**

## Overview

Gojo is a platform that enables anyone, regardless of their technical expertise, to quickly create a web3 prototype in under 10 minutes. With the power of AI, users can build their ideas into functioning prototypes simply by providing a prompt. Whether you're an entrepreneur, developer, or just someone with a cool idea, Gojo helps you bring it to life with ease. Experienced developers can also contribute by sharing valuable knowledge and earning rewards.

## Key Features

- **AI-Driven Prototyping**: Build your web3 prototypes through simple prompts.
- **No-Code Solution**: No prior coding experience needed.
- **Developer Knowledge Sharing**: Experienced developers can monetize their skills and provide insights to help others.
  
## Technologies Used

Gojo leverages a variety of cutting-edge technologies to bring its vision to life:

- **Story Protocol**: For programmable IP ownership, allowing users to manage and control the intellectual property they create.
- **Sign Protocol**: Attests to the split allocation based on code generated by IP posted in the Story Protocol.
- **Phala Network**: Utilized for AI agents that collaborate and work together to enhance user experience.
- **Lit Protocol**: Encrypts all code posted by contributors, with decryption available to Phala for further development.
- **XMTP**: AI chatbot integration for seamless communication and guidance during the building process.
- **NounsDAO**: Promotes public good by allowing users to learn and grow within the ecosystem.
- **Alchemy / Circle / Coinbase**: Integrated to connect wallets and use the app securely.
- **Walrus**: Provides decentralized data storage for all user contributions and prototypes.
- **TheGraph**: Ensures efficient data indexing for querying blockchain data.
- **SKALE**: Scalable blockchain infrastructure for building dApps efficiently.

## How It Works

1. **Enter Your Idea**: Provide a simple prompt describing the web3 prototype you want to build.
2. **AI Magic**: Gojo's AI, powered by multiple agents, will generate the code and structure based on your input.
3. **Customize**: Modify the prototype if needed or share it with developers who can help improve it.
4. **Deploy**: Once you're happy with the result, connect your wallet and deploy the prototype to the blockchain.

## Getting Started

To use Gojo, follow these steps:

1. Sign up on the platform.
2. Connect your wallet (using Alchemy, Circle, or Coinbase).
3. Input your prompt to describe the prototype you want to build.
4. Follow the AI-generated steps to customize and deploy your web3 project.

## Contributing

Developers and web3 enthusiasts are encouraged to contribute to Gojo by:
