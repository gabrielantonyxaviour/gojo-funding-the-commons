### UI Flow

~~DONE - Home Page (mock Vercel AI UI)~~

- Chat page
  1. Once the user sends/creates a chat, it gets redirected to this page.
- No code page
  1. https://ui.aceternity.com/components/expandable-card - when the user clicks on a protocol
- Contribute
  1. Connect github and pass a hardhat project.

### Contribute page

1. Import hardhat project to contribute
2. Need to pass tests.

### No code page

Easy conect - https://reactflow.dev/examples/nodes/easy-connect
Side bar

1. Add node +
   - Choose label
   - Choose chain
   - Choose prompt
2. AI agents

- From Phala response

3. Testing Contract calls

- Normal calls using Coinbase Onchain Kit

4. AI Chat interact with Core.

- XMTP chat interacting with Phala
- Phala interacts with it's available knowledge sources.

5. Export

- Story - Users pays royalty to the contirbutors of the AI agents.
- Lit Protocol - Hence unlocking the key to decrypt the code and export it to github.
-

# Contracts

- Design contracts

- Lit Protocol
- Walrus
- Phala Network

# Sponsors

   Attest the split allocation based on the code generated by the IP posted in Story Protocol
3. Phala Network - 2.5k SET
   AI agents who work with each other
4. Lit Protocol - 3k SET
   To encrypt all the code posted by contributors which can be decrypted by Phala and worked upon
5. XMTP - 2k SET
   AI chat bot
6. NounsDAO - 1k
   Public good. Users can learn
7. Alchemy or Circle or Coinbase - 3k SET
   Connecting a wallet and using the app?
8. Walrus - 2k - SET
   Data storage
9. TheGraph - 3k SET
   Data indexing?
10. SKALE - 4k
    Try to build this mainly for them
11. LayerZero - 3.5k SET
    Story x Base

## TODO

1. Complete Story protocol contract with LayerZero, Base and SKALE.
2. ETHSign Hook
3. Walrus testing?
4. TheGraph indexer

## NEXT TODO

1. Create and test Lit Action (WAITING FOR REPLY)
2. Make Lit work in Node.js (WAITING FOR REPLY)
3. Test Phala AI agents (WAITING FOR REPLY)

## UNIMPORTANT TODO

1. Copy button next to deployment in the node
2. Ask Gojo and app settings should be available also for edges

## AT HACKATHON

1.  Make Phala work
2.  Make Walrus work
3.  Fix Lit issues
4.  Something cool with Coinbase
5.  Something different with SKALE
6.  XMTP

## FLOW

1. User needs to pay and decrypt the data
2. Phala core AI agents encrypt the data when returning to back to the XMTP chat.
3. User can encrypt as long as he pays enough royalties in STORY.
4. Lit Actions. Fetch the latest balance state of IP using theGraph. If enough balance is present, the lit action sends a transaction to consume the decryption to STORY.
5. This will be validated and the decryption signature will be provided
6. You will fetch

## WORKS

1. Phala - 2/10
   - AI
   - MPC Wallets
   - Lit
   - Off chain Attest?
2. Lit Protocol - 6/10 => 7/10
   - Lit Actions Code
   - Lit Client Side
3. Walrus Data storage - 2/10 => 4/10
   - Code upload
   - Website hosting
   - Metadata?
4. TheGraph - 2/10 => 7/10
   - Indexer
   - Testing

8. XMTP - 7/10
   - Chat as AI chat bot
9. SKALE - 5/10 => 7/10
   - Just deploy
   - Different type of chains. Play around?
10. Polygon - 2/10 => 9/10
11. Sign Protocol - 4/10 => 9/10

## AI Agents

1. Openzeppelin
2. Worldcoin
3. LayerZero
4. SKALE
5. Sign Protocol

## Proper Demo Flow

UI (Nouns)
Contracts (LayerZero, Polygon, SKALE)
Indexer (TheGraph)

1. Let's say that I train my domain specific AI agents with some pieces of code. (PHALA + Lit + Walrus)
2. My core AI agent is trained to interact and handle these domain specific AI agents. (PHALA + COINBASE MPC + Sign Protocol)
3. The user enters the app, logs in and clicks on create new project gaslessly using SKALE. (COINBASE)
4. After creating the app, the user can create nodes with prompts aka. AI Agents (XMTP chat + PHALA + Lit)
5. Need to decrypt the encrypted code in the client side and parse it properly (Lit)
6. Run the code in the client side and with smart contract calls interaction (COINBASE)
7. OPTIONAL: Code contribution UI which makes the user import his code directly from Github (Walrus + Lit)

## Tasks

1. Create new project modal - DONE
2. Change to Nouns - DONE
3. Checkout Phala - PENDING
4. Complete base Lit actions -
5. Complete contracts
6. COmplete indexer
7. Try XMTP
